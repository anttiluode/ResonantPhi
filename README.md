An experimental integration of Microsoft’s Phi-2 model with a custom "Wave Neuron" layer that introduces oscillatory dynamics inspired by resonant neural behavior. This project enhances AI responses by leveraging wave-based processing, adapting to input patterns with flexible resonance capabilities.

## Overview

ResonantPhi combines the power of Microsoft’s Phi-2 model with an added layer of "Wave Neurons." These wave neurons simulate oscillatory activity commonly found in biological neural networks, allowing the model to process and adapt to patterns with dynamic resonance. This design explores how wave-like neural processing can improve AI response quality and adaptability in natural language tasks.

## Features

- **Wave Neuron Layer**: Introduces resonant neurons that adapt frequencies based on input, adding oscillatory dynamics.
- **Flexible Frequency and Phase Parameters**: The layer allows customizable wave parameters to experiment with different resonance behaviors.
- **Enhanced Natural Language Processing**: Wave-based modulation changes responses.
